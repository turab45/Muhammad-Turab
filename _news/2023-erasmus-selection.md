I have been selected for the fully funded Erasmus Mundus Joint masters degree in Computational Color and Spectral Imaging (COSI) for the academic year 2023-2025. I will be spending the next semester at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology Norway, University of Jean Monnet France, and University of Eastern Finland. I am excited to explore the culture and academic environment in these countries. I am looking forward to the new experiences and challenges that await me.
