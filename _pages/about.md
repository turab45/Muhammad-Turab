I am Erasmus Mundus Joint masters degree student in [Computational Color and Spectral Imaging (COSI)](https://cosi-master.eu/) at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), University of Jean Monnet (UJM), France and University of Eastern Finland (UEF). My research interests include image processing, computer vision, medical imaging, and eXplainable AI.

I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems Engineering at [Mehran University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.muet.edu.pk/), Jamshoro, Pakistan. I have worked as a Research Assistant at the [Department of Computer Systems Engineering](https://cs.muet.edu.pk/) under the supervision of Dr. Shahnawaz Talpur where I worked on various projects related to image processing, computer vision, and machine learning, and published research papers in reputed journals and conferences.

I am broadly interested in Computer Vision, Image Processing, Medical Imaging, Domain Generalization, eXplainable AI and their applications to real-world problems. I am particularly interested in building reliable (robust) systems that model visual perception with limited supervision and generalizability to unseen domains.
